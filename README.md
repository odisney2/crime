# crime and police report

Population of US over the years and number of crimes compared to number of police officers

This project was to answer the question 
  "Does the number of violent crimes rises or fall depending on the number of police officers in United States?"

## The data that I gathered is the yearly count for the following:

  a. Population
  
  b. Violent Crimes
  
  c. Police Officers
      
## 1. This project is ran using the following steps:

  a.  download/create the two csv files
  
    - population and violent crimes is from one location
    
    - and the number of police officers from another location
    
  b.  create a database if it is not there or connect to the database if it is already created.   The name of the database is violentcrimes.db.   It will be created in the same folder where the three files are stored listed below.
  
  c.  import the data from csv file to the table in the sqlite database
  
      - first delete the tables if it is there so that we can have the correct data
      
      - then the table is created and the data is imported
  
  d. once the import is completed, I confirm that the tables are there and that the data is in fact in the table
  
  e.  created a query that linked between the two tables via the year column.   
  
  f.  used matplotlib to graph my data
  
## 2. You will need the following modules to run the program

  a. sqlite3
  
  b. csv
  
  c. matplotlib.pyplot
  
  d. panda 

## 3.   make sure you have the following files in the same folder

  a.  yearlycrime.ipynb

  b.  population_and_violent_crime_97_2016.csv
  
  c.  number_of_peace_officers_table.csv
  
  
Please reach out to me if you found any issues or have any questions.  

Thanks.
